# readme.md file for p2

Learning HTML has been extremely hard for me, but I have seemingly been getting better as I practice more. I find myself clicking between old assignments frequently in order to figure out how to get the element to work in my current assignment. I have also found that this assignment was created entirely through trial and error. I was constantly saving and opening it on my browser to ensure that everything was appearing how I wanted it to.

I am **very** excited to learn CSS because while creating this assignment, I was getting most frustrated with how things on the page were looking, I really wanted to manipulate the creativity of the webpage, but did not have quite enough knowledge to do so.
