I decided to take this class because of my particular interest in the possiblity of self-employment one day. I am a sophomore at the University and am majoring in Communicative Sciences and Disorders and intend on getting my Master's in Speech Pathology. I have little to no experience in web development but am very excited to learn.

Although overcoming the obstacle of learning all new "lingo" seems **impossible**, I think that I will start to get the hang of everything quickly! I am excited to see that there are many people available to help me, because I assumed that since it was an online class, I would be spending the majority of my freetime figuring out how everything works.

`Thankful that's not the case!`
